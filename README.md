# `autolight`

Tiny Windows program that turns on/off dark theme at sunrise/sunset.

## Configuration

**The configuration file is mandatory.** It's loaded from
`%USERPROFILE%\.autolight.toml`. This file is constantly watched and changes are
applied automatically.

### Example configuration:

#### _%USERPROFILE%\\.autolight.toml_
```toml
# Set this to `true` to terminate the process immediately
disable = false

# Set this to `false` to disable notifications
notifications = true

# Set this to `true` to have dark theme at day and light theme at night
# Why would anyone do this??
invert = false

# Required for the program to work: replace with YOUR coordinates
[location]
latitude = 48.956775
longitude = 2.463845
```

## Building

`autolight` is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)!
Install it to build `autolight` from source.

```
cargo build
```

You can also build in `release` mode:

```
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Just run the executable. It runs in the background. Everything else happens in
the configuration file.

To stop the process, set `disable = true` in the configuration file.
